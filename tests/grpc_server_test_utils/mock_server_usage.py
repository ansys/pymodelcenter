"""A dummy test file showing how the mock servers might be used.

Unfortunately, as you will see if you use this method, this approach
results in very slow tests. We would either have to reuse the server
between tests and reset the servicers, or have to accept each test
taking more than two full seconds apiece. I'll leave this here for now
so that we can reference this approach if we want to test with an actual
server w/ mock implementation for some reason in the future.
