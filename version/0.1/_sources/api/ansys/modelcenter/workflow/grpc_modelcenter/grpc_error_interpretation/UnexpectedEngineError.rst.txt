UnexpectedEngineError
=====================

.. py:exception:: UnexpectedEngineError(message: str, code: grpc.StatusCode)
   :canonical: ansys.modelcenter.workflow.grpc_modelcenter.grpc_error_interpretation.UnexpectedEngineError



Bases: :py:obj:`Exception`


   Raised if an error that is unexpected for the call is made.

   Note that this does not necessarily mean that the gRPC client raised
   an error with the code UNKNOWN or INTERNAL, just that the code
   raised isn't well defined for the call that was made. For example,
   some gRPC methods take only a target element as an argument. The
   client is expected to raise an error with code NOT_FOUND if that
   element is invalid, so a FAILED_PRECONDITION or INVALID_ARGUMENT
   code would be unexpected and could indicate an issue within the
   Python API or the gRPC servicing code.
