   Represents a driver component in a workflow.

   For process-mode workflows, driver components have children.
   Driver components are still represented by instances of this
   interface, even if the workflow is a data-dependency workflow and the
   component in question has no children. (In this case, the ``get_elements()``
   method returns an empty collection).
